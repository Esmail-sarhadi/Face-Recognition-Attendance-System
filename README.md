# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
This project is a face recognition-based attendance system that uses a webcam to capture and recognize faces. The system compares captured faces with known faces and logs the attendance details (name and time) into a CSV file. It uses the face_recognition library for face detection and recognition, and OpenCV for video processing.
